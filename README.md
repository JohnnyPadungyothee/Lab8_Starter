# Lab 8 - Starter

## Check Your Understanding
1. I would fit my automated tests within GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed in my Recipe project development timeline because it would test existing and new code and ensure that nothing breaks before moving on. Manually running tests locally is too time consuming and not efficient while running them all after development is completed is absurd because previous errors would compound together for a disaster.
2. No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output
3. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because the message feature of a MESSAGING app is the majority of the app. It would be built from many other smaller components, such as writing the message, sending the message, and reading the message. The unit tests would be for those smaller componenets.
4. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because this small feature can be encapsulated and separated from the rest of the code and tested.
